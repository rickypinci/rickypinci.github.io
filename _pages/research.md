My research focuses on performance evaluation, cloud computing, cyber-physical systems, and uncertainty propagation.

### Performance Evaluation
The usage of mathematical modeling (queuing networks, Petri nets, and Markov chains), simulation, and experimental evaluation to investigate the performance of large-scale and high-performance computing systems, including Big Data applications and cloud computing systems.

### Cloud Computing
Profiling and modeling of virtual resources for predicting and optimizing the performance of burstable instances and serverless computing in public cloud environments (AWS). The proposed models account for bursty workloads and allow meeting SLOs defined on the latency distribution.

### Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS)
The development of CPS applications in critical scenarios requires an accurate model-based design to early predict CPS behavior and mitigate failures that may reduce CPS effectiveness. My research activity focuses on developing model-based techniques for modeling and analyzing large-scale and spatially distributed CPS subject to uncertainty.

### Uncertainty Propagation
Analysis of dependability and performance models to investigate how uncertainty on input parameters propagates through a model and affects its output measures.

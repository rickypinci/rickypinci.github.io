I have been a Data Scientist at [Zimmer Biomet](https://www.zimmerbiomet.eu/en) within the Global Data & Analytics (DNA) organization since July 2023.

I earned my M.Sc. in Computer Engineering (2014) and my Ph.D. in Information Technology (2018) from Politecnico di Milano. My [doctoral dissertation](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rickypinci/rickypinci.github.io/master/files/PINCIROLI_thesis_PhD.pdf){:target="_blank"} focused on analyzing the energy efficiency of data centers using performance evaluation techniques. Prior to joining Zimmer Biomet, I was a Postdoctoral Fellow at the Gran Sasso Science Institute in Italy.

My research interests include stochastic modeling, performance evaluation, reliability analysis, and uncertainty propagation, with applications to cloud computing, data centers, cyber-physical systems, and IoT environments.

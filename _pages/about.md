I have been a Data Scientist at [Zimmer Biomet](https://www.zimmerbiomet.eu/en) (Market and Competitive Intelligence, EMEA) since July 2023.

I received my M.Sc. in Computer Engineering (2014) and my Ph.D. in Information Technology (2018) from Politecnico di Milano. In my [doctoral dissertation](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rickypinci/rickypinci.github.io/master/files/PINCIROLI_thesis_PhD.pdf){:target="_blank"}, I analyzed the energy efficiency of data centers by employing performance evaluation techniques. Before joining Zimmer Biomet, I was a Postdoctoral Fellow at the Gran Sasso Science Institute (Italy).

My research interests include stochastic modeling, performance evaluation, reliability analysis, and uncertainty propagation applied to cloud computing, data centers, cyber-physical systems, and IoT environments.
